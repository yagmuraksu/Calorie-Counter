# Calorie-Counter
This project allows the user to control consumed calories within a budget. This is a tutorial followed from the freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification program.

# What this program do?
The user determines a budget calorie for the day. Then, four different types of meals are added that belong to categories **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Dinner** and **Snacks**. While these shorten the calorie budget, if the user adds an exercise entry, the calorie budget increases. At the end of the page, **Calorie Deficit**, **Consumed Calories** and **Burned Calories** information is shown.

# Necessities
Once compiled with the javascript file, the interface html file will be able to give the user to play the game with the design provided by the CSS file.
